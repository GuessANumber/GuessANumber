# Guess A Number

How often did you read "HelloWorld"-like programs and still had no clue about
the syntax of the language you are looking at?

The "Guess A Number" aims at showing off at least a little more syntax by 
defining a programm everyone can relate to: The infamous guess my number-game.

Let the program find a number between 1 and 100, and then guess it. Well, it could 
be that easy, but there's a catch: Let the program find the number by itself!

With this simple example you will get a lot of basic syntax at a glance: random
number generators, loops, decisions, basic arithmetics, string handling and output.
